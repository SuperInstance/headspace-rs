//! The fleet polyformalism canary.

//! `headspace_rs::fnv1a64` is FNV-1a 64, the same digest every other substrate in the
//! fleet agrees on. Asserting it here means a change to the hash — a wrong prime, an
//! offset, a signed multiply — fails this crate's own test suite rather than producing
//! digests that quietly disagree with the rest of the fleet.
